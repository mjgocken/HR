# Final_Bonus
This was the final exam bonus project for CISC637 Intro to Database Systems.
In the final exam we built a schema in Oracle; the bonus asked for a Visual Studio solution including HR.EF project and HR.UT project, 
with the schema scaffolded and the UT Project to test select, update, insert and delete for each table.  

What I did: The EF project is created and the database tables are scaffolded in; 
the UT project is created, and the appsettings.json is copied, but the tests are not implemented.
